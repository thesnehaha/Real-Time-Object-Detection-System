Real-time object detection is a critical task in computer vision with applications ranging from sur-
veillance to autonomous vehicles. This project focuses on implementing real-time object detection

using Python and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library). OpenCV provides a robust
framework for image processing and object detection, while Python offers ease of programming
and integration with other libraries.
The project begins with preprocessing the input video stream or webcam feed to improve the
quality and reduce noise. Then, a pre-trained deep learning model, such as YOLO (You Only
Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), is utilized for detecting objects in the video
frames. These models are capable of detecting multiple objects simultaneously and are optimized
for real-time performance.The implementation involves loading the pre-trained model, configuring
it for real-time inference, and processing each frame of the video stream to detect objects.
